## Problem solving patterns 

### Frequency counter pattern

This pattern uses objects or sets to collect values or frequrncies of values. This pattern can help to avoid O(n ** 2) solution to the problem(nested loops). This pattern is useful in problems whrn you have multiple pieces of data/ inputs you need to compare them to see if they consists of similar values, if they are anagram of one another, if a value is contained inside of another value, anytime you're comparing pieces of data to inputs and frequencies of certain things occur.       

### MULTIPLE POINTERS

Creating pointers or values that correspond to an index or position and move towards the beginning, end or middle based on a certain condition Very efficient for solving problems with minimal space complexity as well
