## Problem solving patterns

### Frequency counter pattern

This pattern uses objects or sets to collect values or frequrncies of values. This pattern can help to avoid O(n \*\* 2) solution to the problem(nested loops). This pattern is useful in problems when you have multiple pieces of data/ inputs you need to compare them to see if they consists of similar values, if they are anagram of one another, if a value is contained inside of another value, anytime you're comparing pieces of data to inputs and frequencies of certain things occur.

### Multiple Pointers Pattern

Creating pointers or values that correspond to an index or position and move towards the beginning, end or middle based on a certain condition Very efficient for solving problems with minimal space complexity as well

### Sliding Window Pattern

This pattern involves creating a window which can either be an array or number from one position to another. Depending on a certain condition, the window either increases or closes(and a new window is created). This pattern is useful when we have a set of data like an array or a string and we're looking for a subset of that data that is continuous.

The Sliding Window approach is useful when you have a set of data (like a string or array) and you are looking for a continuous subset of the data. We create a window (which can be a subarray or substring) and move the window depending on a condition.

### Divide and Conquer Pattern

This pattern involves dividing a data set into smaller chunks and repeating a process with a subset of data. Sorting algorihm like Quick sort and Merge sort uses this pattern so as Binary search.
