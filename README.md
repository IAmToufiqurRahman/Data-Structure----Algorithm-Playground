## Problem solving patterns

### Frequency counter pattern

This pattern uses objects or sets to collect values or frequrncies of values. This pattern can help to avoid O(n \*\* 2) solution to the problem(nested loops). This pattern is useful in problems when you have multiple pieces of data/ inputs you need to compare them to see if they consists of similar values, if they are anagram of one another, if a value is contained inside of another value, anytime you're comparing pieces of data to inputs and frequencies of certain things occur.

### Multiple Pointers Pattern

Creating pointers or values that correspond to an index or position and move towards the beginning, end or middle based on a certain condition Very efficient for solving problems with minimal space complexity as well

### Sliding Window Pattern

This pattern involves creating a window which can either be an array or number from one position to another. Depending on a certain condition, the window either increases or closes(and a new window is created). This pattern is useful when we have a set of data like an array or a string and we're looking for a subset of that data that is continuous.

The Sliding Window approach is useful when you have a set of data (like a string or array) and you are looking for a continuous subset of the data. We create a window (which can be a subarray or substring) and move the window depending on a condition.

### Divide and Conquer Pattern

This pattern involves dividing a data set into smaller chunks and repeating a process with a subset of data. Sorting algorihm like Quick sort and Merge sort uses this pattern so as Binary search.

### Recursion

A recursive function is a function that invokes itself. Recursive function should have two main features: a base case and be invokes with different input each time. A different design pattern of recursive funtion can be implemented with the help of helper function.

### Sorting algorithms

Implemented six sorting algorithms such as bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort, quick sort and redix sort. Except redix sort all the sorting algorithms are comparison based sorting. Among them merge sort and quick sort have better time complexity. My personal favourite among sorting algorithms is merge sort because of its simple implementation by divide and conquer technique and its efficiency is also higher than others.

### Signly Linked List

Implemented push, pop, shift, unshift, get, set, insert, remove, reverse operation in singly linked list.

### Doubly Linked List

Implemented push, pop, shift, unshift, get, set, insert, remove operation in doubly linked list.

### Stack & Queue

Stack works in LIFO principle and Queue works in FIFO. Implemented push and pop for stack and enqueue, dequeue method for queue

### Binary Search Tree

Implemented binary search tree algorithm with two method such as insert and find 

### Tree Traversal
